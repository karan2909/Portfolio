# Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a passionate data scientist with experience in machine learning, data analysis, and cloud deployment. I enjoy exploring data, deriving insights, and building predictive models to solve real-world problems.
I have expertise in solving business problems through data driven insights using tools like Python, SQL, Pyspark, R, Hive, Hadoop, along with visualisation tools like Tableau. Currently, I am pursuing MS in Computational Data Science at Georgia Tech. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have 6 years of experience working in analytics and data science field. I have worked with Credit Suisse(Counterparty Credit Risk) and Airtel (Credit Risk). I have graudated from IIT Guwahati with a degree in Chemical Engineering.

### [Project 2: Crime Prediction in Atlanta](https://github.com/karan2909/Churn_deployment_heroku)
- Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict crime in Atlanta.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized various data visualization techniques.
- Crime clustering utilizing GMM algorithm with latitude and longitude data.
- Geographical clusters receive risk scores indicating crime severity, offering monthly and yearly risk profiles.
- Time series modeling, specifically Exponential Smoothing, employed to forecast crime risk scores from 2019 to 2020 using data spanning 2009 to 2018.
- Visualization of results on an interactive map of Atlanta.
