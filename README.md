### [Project 2: Crime Prediction in Atlanta](https://github.com/karan2909/Churn_deployment_heroku)
- Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict crime in Atlanta.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized various data visualization techniques.
- Crime clustering utilizing GMM algorithm with latitude and longitude data.
- Geographical clusters receive risk scores indicating crime severity, offering monthly and yearly risk profiles.
- Time series modeling, specifically Exponential Smoothing, employed to forecast crime risk scores from 2019 to 2020 using data spanning 2009 to 2018.
- Visualization of results on an interactive map of Atlanta.

### [Project 3: Causal Inference](https://github.com/karan2909/Causal_Inference)
- Causal inference techniques, specifically the CausalImpact model, are applied to the preprocessed data to estimate the causal effect of the promotion on sales. This involves comparing the observed sales data during the promotion period with counterfactual sales data derived from similar stores without promotions.
- The results of the causal inference analysis are evaluated to determine the significance and magnitude of the causal effect. Statistical metrics and visualizations are utilized to interpret the findings and draw actionable insights.

### [Project 5: Customer Segmentation and Retention](https://github.com/karan2909/ECom--Retention-and-Segmentation)
- To find segmentation of customers for their online store for promotions/discount.

## 1) Feature Engineering
- RFM Features: Recency, Tenure, Frequency, Monetary.
- Product Diversity: Number of Products Purchased.
- Behavioral Features: Average Days Between Purchases, Favorite Day for Shopping.
- Geographical Features: Is from UK or not.
- Cancellation Features: Canceled Flag, Number of canceled orders.

## 2) Retention

## 3) Customer Segmentation - Heuristic and Kmeans
Customers are segmented into different clusters based on:
- Recency: How recently they did the transaction.
- Frequency: How often the customers are doing transactions.
- Monetary: Average Order Value per customer basket.
