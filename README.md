# Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a passionate data scientist with experience in machine learning, data analysis, and cloud deployment. I enjoy exploring data, deriving insights, and building predictive models to solve real-world problems.
I have expertise in solving business problems through data driven insights using tools like Python, SQL, Pyspark, R, Hive, Hadoop, along with visualisation tools like Tableau. Currently, I am pursuing MS in Computational Data Science at Georgia Tech. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have 6 years of experience working in analytics and data science field. I have worked with Credit Suisse(Counterparty Credit Risk) and Airtel (Credit Risk). I have graudated from IIT Guwahati with a degree in Chemical Engineering.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Classification and Cloud Deployment](https://github.com/karan2909/Churn_deployment_heroku)
- Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict Employee Attrition using various algorithms.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using data visualization techniques.
- Achieved good recall on the 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' dataset from Kaggle, using Logistic Regression.
- Implemented a WEB API using the Flask framework and deployed it on the Heroku cloud platform.

### [Project 2: Crime Prediction in Atlanta](https://github.com/karan2909/Churn_deployment_heroku)
- Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict crime in Atlanta.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized various data visualization techniques.
- Crime clustering utilizing GMM algorithm with latitude and longitude data.
- Geographical clusters receive risk scores indicating crime severity, offering monthly and yearly risk profiles.
- Time series modeling, specifically Exponential Smoothing, employed to forecast crime risk scores from 2019 to 2020 using data spanning 2009 to 2018.
- Visualization of results on an interactive map of Atlanta.

### [Project 3: Causal Inference](https://github.com/karan2909/Causal_Inference)
- Causal inference techniques, specifically the CausalImpact model, are applied to the preprocessed data to estimate the causal effect of the promotion on sales. This involves comparing the observed sales data during the promotion period with counterfactual sales data derived from similar stores without promotions.
- The results of the causal inference analysis are evaluated to determine the significance and magnitude of the causal effect. Statistical metrics and visualizations are utilized to interpret the findings and draw actionable insights.
